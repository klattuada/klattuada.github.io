        <h1><em>About me</em></h1>
        <p><p> My name is Kevin Lattuada and I am from Manfield Massachusetts. I played lacrosse and wrestled in high school,<br>
and was the only Kevin in my class. I have been using technology and computers all my life, from VCR's to gaming consoles.<br>
My close family are all involed with computers and have been for most of their lives. My mother is a computer programmer<br>
for the government, my father is a data managment ownder, and my brother is a cybersecurity analist and digital forencics<br>
analysist. My family all went to college at the start of new chapters with computers; my parents started when computers<br>
were starting to be used more by companies, and my brother went into cybersecurity becasue of the need for cybersecurity<br>
specialists.<br>
I am big into movies, tv shows, and sports. I am a Boston sports fan, but I have never been to a Celtics or Bruins game.<br>
The most recent shows I've watched are: Mindhunter, Top Gear, Veep, The IT Crowd, Silicon Valley, and Time Force.<br>
My dream job is to be a penitration tester, or plumber.
