        This webpage was written in my CSC 106 class at the University of Rhode Island.

            This page is the home page and has links for you to navigate through my webage to see my code and read about me.<br>
            I will be learning how to code in my CSC 106 class, and I hope to increase my skills in programming with the help of this class.<br>
            By the end of this class I hope to have learned and mastered skills that will help me in my future careers.<br>
            By the end of this class I hope this webpage will be filled with multiple different programs.<br>
