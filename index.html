        <h1>Welcome to Kevin's Webpage</h1>
        This webpage was written in my CSC 106 class at the University of Rhode Island.
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th id="Home"><img src="pasted image 0 (1).png"></th>
                    <th id="JavaScript"><img src="pasted image 0.png"></th>
                    <th id="About Me"><img src="pasted image 0 (2).png"></th>
                </tr>

        <p>This Webpage is a place where I will be sharing information about myself and my programs<br>
            I will be learning how to code in my CSC 106 class, and I hope to increase my skills in programming with the help of this class.<br>
            By the end of this class I hope to have learned and mastered skills that will help me in my future careers.<br>
            By the end of this class I hope this webpage will be filled with multiple different programs.
